## Overview

E-MLB is about a simple benchmark for denoising, both including a multi-level denoising dataset, an evaluation metric and the implementation of some SOTA algorithms. More details can be found in the [paper](https:xxxx) and [video](https:xxxx).



## Installation

Create a new virtual environment if needed:
```
conda create -n EMLB python=3.8
conda activate EMLB
```

Then clone this repo and install the dependencies, we'll call the directory that you cloned as `${EMLB_ROOT}`:
```
cd ${EMLB_ROOT}
git clone https://github.com/KugaMas/EMLB.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Example

Run EMLB with the following command:
```
TODO
```
Then you will receive MESR score on your terminal as follows:

*place an example result table here*

### Build your own denoising algorithm

We provide a general template to facilitate you to evaluate your own denoising algorithm, see `${EMLB_ROOT}/scripts/utils/denoisors.py`. An example code see below:

```python
class your_own_denoisor(EventDenoisors):
    def __init__(self, size, use_polarity=True, excl_hotpixel=True, param1, param2):
        super().__init__()
        self.name           = 'Template'
        self.annotation     = 'Template'
        self.use_polarity   = use_polarity
        self.excl_hotpixel  = excl_hotpixel

        self.params = {
          'param1' : param1,
          'param2' : param2
        }
    
    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, ev, fr):
        ts, x, y, p = self.pre_prosess(self, ev, size)
        # /*--------------------------------------*/
        # input your denoising implementation here
        # /*--------------------------------------*/
        return ev
```

## Dataset

**Download** We captures a brand new Event Noisy Dataset (**END**). It should be divided into [D-END](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZatTSewmb-j6RsrJxMWEQIE3Sm1yraK-/view?usp=sharing) (Daytime part) and [N-END](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZDhuYdtHui9nqJAfiYYX27omPY7Rpl9/view?usp=sharing) (Night part), which you can download directly. The dataset structure is as follows:

```
${EMLB_ROOT}/Datasets/
├── D-CEND
│   ├── Architecture
│   │   ├── Architecture-ND00-1.aedat4
│   │   ├── Architecture-ND00-2.aedat4
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── Bicycle
│   │   ├── Bicycle-ND00-1.aedat4
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
│   |
├── DVS NOISE20
│   ├── alley
│   │   ├── alley-1.aedat4
│   │   ├── alley-2.aedat4
│
├── ...
```

**Add-on** You can download or collect a new dataset and put them in `${EMLB_ROOT}/Datasets`, it should rearranged in the following structure: 

```
${EMLB_ROOT}/Datasets/
├── Your Dataset
│   ├── Subclass-1
│   │   ├── Sequences-1.*
│   │   ├── Sequences-2.*
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── Subclass-2
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
```

### Supports
At present, we only support reading `aedat4`, `.pkl`, `.h5` and `.txt` files. 
+ The details of `aedat4` can be checked in [here](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/dv-python#open-a-recording-made-with-dv). The layout of `.pkl` or `.h5` files should be similar with `.aedat4` as follows:
```
data = {
  'events': [
    t1 x1 y1 p1
    t2 x2 y2 p2
    t3 x3 y3 p3
    ...
  ],
  'frames': [
    frame1 t1
    frame2 t2
  ],
}
```

+ If you are using `.txt` as input files, please make sure they are matched format used as follows:
```
width height
t1 x1 y1 p1
t2 x2 y2 p2
t3 x3 y3 p3
...
```



## Benchmarks

### Prerequisites

To ensure the execution of denoisors, you need to download additional [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries to help our cpp file compile. If you have installed them before, you can skip this step and directly modify the reference of `CMakeLists.txt`.

```
cd ${EMLB_ROOT}
mkdir extern
```

**pybind11**

```
# install necessary compile environment
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

# clone pybind11 in our repository, or you can put them in another path
git submodule add -b stable https://github.com/pybind/pybind11 extern/pybind11
```

**libtorch**
```
cd extern

wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu116/libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.12.0%2Bcu116.zip
unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.12.0+cu116.zip

```
