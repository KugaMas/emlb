# KDTree

Simple C++ static KD-Tree implementation with minimal functionality.

- points are given as STL vectors (and inserted in their own STL vector) so supports n-dimensional points for any n
- makes full trees, (i.e. does not cut-off the branching at some arbitrary level) giving the nearest neighbor query have (strong) logarithmic complexity.
- builds the tree in one go (does not support adding nodes, the tree is built from a list of points and cannot be altered afterwards)
- points are assumed to be STL vectors
- it provides the following queries:
	- nearest neighbor
	- neighbors within a given distance
